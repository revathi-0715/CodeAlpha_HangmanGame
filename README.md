This is a simple text-based Hangman game built in Python as part of the CodeAlpha internship. The player guesses a randomly selected word one letter at a time, with a maximum of 6 incorrect attempts allowed. The game uses basic console input/output and demonstrates key Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and list handling.
